Eradication and management of rats (Rattus rattus) is of vital importance to biosecurity in Japan. Kill trap operations have proved the ability to eradicate and control populations sufficient for the protection of native species but require intensive and continued maintenance and expense. Goodnature Limited and the Department of Conservation collaborated to develop a state-of the art self resetting trap for rats to exceed the annual performance of current trap schedules with no human intervention, lightweight, durable, computer controlled and user friendly. Development and testing was completed in June 2023 resulting in a new control tool which kills, clears and resets twelve times before requiring human intervention. This development allows entire control networks to achieve a "knockdown period' and then remain 100% available to pest predators, dramatically reducing labour required in operation set up and maintenance. It is speculated that this tool will lead to new operational strategies allowing eradication and management of rats in significantly larger areas, Companies are eager to develop and get this device avoiding cables to be gnawed. The strategy is very simple. It relies on a series of tubes running along buildings, using the old system

of pneumatic mails. At intervals, holes are created to enable the access to future predators. Easily

controlled by remote computers, shutters situated above, capture the rodents after the temperature has

risen one degree inside the tube, thanks to heat sensors fitted inside behind each hole. Then, they

close over the tubes and the rodent is trapped. From then on, a fan triggers off a ball which carries the rat to a place where it is frozen. Once the process is achieved, another fan blows the ball back to its starting position and the shutters open, ready for another rodent to get in. Replacing the system of bird monitoring like in Windy Hill in 2021, This system allows a quick, safe, ecological way to preserve the environment and the work efficiency.

Rats have historically been a problem in human living environments. They are a source of diseases, What's more, they cause property damage, gnawing the computer wires, affecting the image of a company. Replacing the traditional chesse trap, this no fuss, odourless state-of-the-art system called the J-line, is an oppportunity today to turn a nightmare into a dream.

TASKS TO PERFORM: 6 hours + 2 hours presentaion)

TASKA: Give a written secount of this text in inglish, highlighting the context, the pros sand con of the device as well as its potential applications. ('150 words). Hand it in on ED with your individua name.

TASK 2: After having read the text carefully, Thanks to the technical elements given :

A-Create the J-line system with a 3D software (sketch up, Solidworks of other and insert into a Canva slideshow in which the system will be explained with an accurate plan of you choice (see the plans given at the beginning of the year). You will have to describe how the system runs. (This task may be performed in groups of 3. Make sure your group includes student able to draw a 3D diagram).

B- Imagine the home page of the railway Japanese company J-TREC. They actually want t implement the remote J-Line computer controlled rat trap; you will display on the page the following categories: product/technology/sustainability/company/contact/More../

TASK 3; Role play. You are in charge of displaying the revolutionary J-Line device implemented b the Jaanese Firm to the manager of the J-TREC railway company. With your group (manager developer/technician concept designer):
